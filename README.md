## Introduction:

The EGX 30 Index is a key indicator of the performance of the Egyptian stock market, comprising the top 30 companies listed on the Egyptian Exchange. Predicting its movements accurately can provide valuable insights for investors and traders. LSTM neural networks have shown promise in predicting stock prices by learning patterns from historical data. This project aims to leverage LSTM to predict EGX 30 stock prices and analyze market behavior.

## Methodology:
### Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize the features, and create sequential input-output pairs suitable for training the LSTM model.
### LSTM Model Architecture: A recurrent neural network architecture, specifically LSTM, is designed to learn from the sequential nature of stock price data. The model consists of input, hidden, and output layers, with LSTM units capturing temporal dependencies.
### Training the Model: The LSTM model is trained on historical EGX 30 data using a portion of the dataset. The training process involves optimizing model parameters to minimize prediction errors.
### Model Evaluation: The trained LSTM model is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess its predictive performance. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are computed.
### Prediction and Analysis: The trained LSTM model is used to make predictions on unseen EGX 30 data. The predicted stock prices are analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and potential trading opportunities.

## Results:
The results of the LSTM-based stock price prediction and analysis for the EGX 30 Index will include:
Accuracy metrics for the LSTM model.
Predicted EGX 30 stock prices compared to actual prices.
Visualizations of predicted price trends and market analysis.
Insights into market behavior and potential investment strategies.
## Conclusion:
By applying LSTM neural networks to predict EGX 30 stock prices and analyze market trends, this project aims to provide valuable insights for investors and traders operating in the Egyptian stock market. The effectiveness of LSTM in capturing temporal dependencies makes it a promising approach for stock price prediction and analysis tasks.
